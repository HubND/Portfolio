Intended to be an rpg with multiple heist-style levels that blended slow and high pace gameplay with the use of a Hyper mode (in which the player moves significantly faster and louder and has a set of skills that compliments this) and Noir mode (the quieter, sneakier opposite of Hyper). The gameplay experience was designed to present a reasonable challenge that would reward the player for switching between these two modes on the fly as they were faced with various problems and situations.

Controls -
WASD or direction keys to move
Space bar to jump
Q to activate Hyper mode (While in Hyper mode, shift to bash doors)
E to activate Noir mode
F to interact (doors, lightswitches, etc.)
