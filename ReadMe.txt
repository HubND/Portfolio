Hello and thank you for taking the time to look at my work.

In this repository you will find a number of folders containing various pieces I have developed and here I will detail some of the relevant background information for each of them.

About Time - Submission as part of the Global Game Jam 2014, developed as part of a 4-man team, where the theme was "We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are".

Untitled game (unfinished) - Independent project on hold (as per information in my CV). Originally planned to be a full RPG style game, currently has title screen, outline of intro and first level, and interim scene.

Stairs (ongoing) - Smaller scale project, designed to be a more story focused "walking-simulator" style game. Has the full game outlined, though many of the interactions and plot points are yet to be implemented.
